# Mapping German Fiction in Translation: Network Analysis

This repository contains scripts and result tables of chapter 3 (THE LANGUAGE NETWORK OF GERMAN FICTION IN TRANSLATION, pages 101-135) of my thesis project **"Mapping German fiction in translation in the German National Library catalogue (1980-2020)"** which is available here: https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/0p096d03z

## Dataset

The source dataset has been extracted from the German National Library catalogue in 2021. It is currently being prepared for publication on a Dataverse under a creative commons open access license.

## Description

The R script contains several measures and visualizations for the translation network of German fiction, such as centrality scores, community detection, and geographic mapping by language communities and publishing places.

## How to use this repository
Please install the latest R and Rstudio version to run this code. Packages should run smoothly on R version 4.3.1.

Run the script MappingDNB_socialnet_ch3.R with the data in the data folder, section by section (I do not recommend running it all at once since some functiosn take significant CPU usage).
