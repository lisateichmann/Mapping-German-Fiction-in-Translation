## Project Description
This thesis project is dedicated to making translations visible and disentangling the roles of the author, place of publication, and language in carving the paths that German fiction travels in the world of literature. These channels of transfer are documented in archives of national literatures and this project presents an unprecedented study of translated German fiction by sourcing bibliographic data of translations from the German National Library. It is a first attempt at utilizing the wealth of data openly accessible through the library catalogue and at designing, exploring, and testing a quantitative model of analysis for German fiction in translation, drawing on social network analysis, descriptive statistics, and geomapping. By analyzing the role certain languages and authors play in the field of translation, this thesis investigates which works of fiction and authors are overrepresented and which ones are marginal in the translation network. This thesis builds on the notion of translationalism—that certain authors set themselves apart by connecting several linguistic communities in geographic space—as a driving force behind the literary transfer of translations. Translationalism, as argued here, invites the reader to re-evaluate what is categorized as world literature by drawing attention to the role of the national canon and the national collection in the global circulation of German fiction in translation.
